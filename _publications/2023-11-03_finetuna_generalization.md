excerpt: 'In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the broader application of Finetuna, an active learning framework to accelerate structural relaxation in DFT with prior information from Open Catalyst Project pretrained graph neural networks. We explore the challenges associated with out-of-domain systems: alcohol (C>2) on metal surfaces as larger adsorbates, metal-oxides with spin polarization, and three-dimensional (3D) structures like zeolites and metal-organic-frameworks.'
