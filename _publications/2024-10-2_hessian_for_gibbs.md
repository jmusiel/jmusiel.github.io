excerpt: 'We demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cmâˆ’1 mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K.'
