I am currently working as a Machine Learning Scientist for Chemistry at [Entalpic](https://entalpic.ai/), where I lead the effort to develop an active learning pipeline for chemistry. Together we are combining AI, computational chemistry, and experimental labs to discover novel materials and accelerate materials discovery.

I completed my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [John Kitchin](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kitchin-john.html) and [Zachary Ulissi](https://zulissi.github.io/). 
My research focused on active learning and transfer learning techniques to adapt large-scale graph neural networks to low-resource problems in catalysis. 
I developed machine learning frameworks capable of accelerating molecular simulations of catalytic systems by orders of magnitude, with the aim of helping to address societal energy and environmental challenges, particularly climate change. 
I collaborated with the FAIR Chemistry [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/) to make use of large graph neural networks to discover new catalysts for renewable energy storage. 
I also developed uncertainty quantification approaches for graph neural networks which improved their reliability and trustworthiness. 

I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science, at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in 2019. 
There I was involved in researching carbon nanotube biosensors advised by [Nigel Reuel](http://www.reuelgroup.org/)
I also participated in research into using novel MOFs for carbon capture, which were deployed on the NASA Artemis missions as part of the *NASA X-Hab Academic Innovation Challenge*.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends. 
I love board games and outdoor activities â€“ my favorites being *Race for the Galaxy* and canoeing. 
And I always appreciate the opportunity to try a new IPA or sour.

If you have questions about my research or want to collaborate on anything, feel free to reach out to me via email.
