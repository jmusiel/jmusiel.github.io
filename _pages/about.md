I am a PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/). I work on active learning and transfer learning techniques to adapt large-scale graph neural networks to low-resource problems in catalysis. I strive to develop methods and frameworks capable of accelerating molecular simulations of catalytic systems by orders of magnitude, with the aim of helping to address societal energy and environmental challenges, particularly climate change. I collaborate with the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/) to make use of the large-scale graph models developed to discover new catalysts for use in renewable energy storage. I am also very interested in the application of uncertainty metrics for graph neural networks to making these methods more robust and reliable. 

I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science, at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in 2019. There I was involved in researching carbon nanotube biosensors advised by [Nigel Reuel](http://www.reuelgroup.org/), and with research into using novel MOFs for carbon capture on the NASA Artemis missions as part of the *NASA X-Hab Academic Innovation Challenge*.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I love board games and outdoor activities â€“ my favorites being Agricola and skiing. And I always appreciate the opportunity to try a new IPA or sour.

If you have questions about my research or want to collaborate on anything, feel free to reach out to me via email.
